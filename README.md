This is the read me file! Feel free to leave notes and updates on what you may have added or notes you want to leave! It's pretty easy to edit, there should be a marker somewhere near the title of the file (if you are a collaborator)

I put some code inside so that you can look into how some React.js works and how to link JavaScript libraries, such as something from Node.js or npm, into a HTML file. It isn't connected or uploaded so that needs to be done soon. :P

### James Roche
cool! Semi-related- I'm kind of avoiding React and MongoDB for now, just so I can focus on understanding as much of Node, Express and npm as possible, but there will probably be a decent amount of overlapped concepts we should aim to avoid. Especially with the intro (JavaScript and basic benefits of MERN?)
